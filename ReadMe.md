# Introduction to Research Methods Project

## Abstract
Books often have distinct linguistic features which can help us identify its writer, genre or other information . One of those linguistic features
is the rate of usage of personality adjectives, which are adjectives that describe character features. In this study I will be looking at the 
difference in the rate of usage of personality adjectives between a fiction writer and a historian. The result of this study can indicate whether
this information is useful for genre detection tools.
                                                                                            

## Background Information
Although there have been studies on the use of personality adjectives, none have focussed specifically on differences between genres.
Steppan, M. (2020) studied the trends in the use of personality adjectives in American and British literature between 1800 and 2010.
Mazdayasna, G. and Firouzi, M. (2013) studied the rate of using adjectives generally between literary and technical texts, and found that
adjectives are used at a much higher rate in the technical texts.

## Research Question and Hypothesis:
Research Question: at what rate are personality adjectives used in history books and fiction, and what is the difference?
Hypothesis: personality adjectives are used at a higher rate in fiction books

## Methods
This study will focus on the works of two writers whose works are in the public domain and available on Project Gutenberg, novelist 
Charles Dickens and historian Gustavo Maspero. Using a Python script I will count the personality adjectives used in each of the writer's works.
I will use a list of 435 personality adjectives by Saucier and Goldberg (1996). Then I will divide the number of personality adjectives used by the total amount of words in the texts.
